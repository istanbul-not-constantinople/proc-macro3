# proc-macro3
POV: get rickrolled.

So basically I noticed that [this crate](https://crates.io/crates/proc-macro3) has a link to this repository that redirects to a new repository, presumably because the owner changed his github name. I decided to just make a new github organization and create a new repository with this in it. This doesn't actually affect anyone because the repository link is just an arbitrary text while the actual crate source code is stored directly on crates.io and only updated when the owner runs the publish command.
